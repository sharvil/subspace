----------
SUN_CREAM
----------
is a gtk2/Metacity theme for Gnome created mainly for my own need of a theme that was pleasant and
clean to the eye, but also really useable.
Initially inspired by the very nice "Digital-Cream" theme by roberTo, it has taken its own path with
touches of yellow (thus the Sun) that broke the "absolutely smooth" coolness but added visibility
to focused windows and widgets.
All widgets have been redrawn or heavily modified so to offer visibilty and feedback, but hopefully
not distraction when really working with them.

0.9.2
Metacity:
